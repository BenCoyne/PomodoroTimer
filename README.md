## Quick build of a Pomodoro Timer 🍅

According to Wikipedia, the Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## How it works ⏲️

By operating the associated buttons, users can run a countdown timer of 25 minutes, 10 minutes or 5 minutes. The User can start, stop or reset the Timer. 

## Try it for yourself 🙂
